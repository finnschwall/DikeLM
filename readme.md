# Overview
DikeLM is a composition of [Dike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dike_(mythology)) the greek goddess
of fair judgement (among other things) and language model[^1].

It is an evaluation platform for chat based language models. A more in-depth explanation can be
found [here](https://github.com/finnschwall/DikeLM/blob/main/eval_concept.md)

DikeLM is part of the broader development of the [RIXA framework](https://github.com/finnschwall/RIXA).
Have a look if you want to see a cool use case of this project or LLMs in general.
